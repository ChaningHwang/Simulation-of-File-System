# Simulation-of-File-System

Used python in Linux System to simulate the real client/server based file system which can implement make directory, create files, write, read, move and remove function under the situation of with or without one of the servers fail. Principle of Computer System Design course project.

This project builds a client/server-based file system where the client can access the data blocks stored in four servers with support for redundant block storage. To enforce the modularity, the client/server form is designed to reduce error propagation. The remote procedure call is the only way for message to transmit between client and servers. By implementing commands like mkdir, create, write, read, mv, rm, basic functionality of a client/server rpc file system is displayed. During the project period, practical issues have been handled to help better understanding principle of computer system design.
